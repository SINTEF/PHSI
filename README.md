# Pseudo-Hamiltonian system identification

The folder named `phsi` contains code for the pseudo-Hamiltonian system identification (PHSI) model, building on the [phlearn package](https://github.com/SINTEF/pseudo-hamiltonian-neural-networks). The notebooks shows how the PHSI model performs for a number of different problems, compared to existing methods and a baseline model that do not assume a pseudo-Hamiltonian structure.

See [(Holmsen et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06920) for a description of the PHSI model and a report on the results obtained by the notebooks.
